# 🚀 Flask Projects Collection

Welcome to my **Flask_Projects** repository!  
This repo contains all the small and medium-sized Flask applications that I build while learning, experimenting, and improving my web-development skills.

Each project focuses on a specific concept such as:
- Routing (GET/POST)
- Templates & Jinja2
- Forms handling
- Session management
- Template inheritance
- Authentication basics
- Working with databases (optional in some projects)
- Static files (CSS/JS)
- Clean project structure
